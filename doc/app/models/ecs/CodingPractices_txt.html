<p>Preamble:</p>

<pre>This document attempts to highlight key coding practices for this project.
Feel free to propose amendments or changes to this document.

As I have found in development thus far, many of these practices will be tremendously
helpful for us moving on. Proper documentation helps each other to understand
code others have written along with nuances of the system. Testing has litterly
exposed several errors in my programs. Such errors would have been a pain
to uncover later when we are dealing with a larger system.

Taking effort in the beginning to develop &quot;beautiful code&quot; as the
teacher would say will pay dividends in the future. It is much easier to
document and get a file working now when it is first created than when
it is part of a massive system with many interconnected parts.</pre>

<p>Practices:</p>

<pre>A. Comments

        1) For each method, provide introductory documentation:

                a) The simplist case is:

                        # Description of what method does
                        #
                        # Arguments
                        #   arg = ...
                        #   ...
                        #
                        # Returns
                        #   ...
                        #
                        # Notes
                        #   Key notes about the function whether it be how
                        #   to call the function, more about its return results,
                        #   or an explanation of nuances in implementation.
                        def method(arg, ...)

                b) If a function is not intended to have a return, describe its
                postcondition instead

                        # This function should do xy
                        #
                        # Arguments
                        #   arg = ....
                        #
                        # Postcondition
                        #   The piece should be added to the board
                        def method(arg)

                c) If the method is extremely simple, a one line comment will
                suffice

                        # Returns a string representation of the object
                        def to_s

        2) For each class, provide introductary comments

                =begin
                        This is the best class ever. When describing your
                        best class, talk a little about what it is, what it does,
                        and why it is important.

                        If there&#39;s anything particular the world should know
                        about the class (such as how it is used), include it also
                =end
                class BestClassEver

        3) For nuances in the code, make sure to document them:

                a) In the code

                        This is an example from motion_system.rb. result is an
                        array of square entities that a moveable_entity can move
                        to.

                        # Don&#39;t include the square the entity is currently standing on.
                        result.delete entity_manager.board[pos_comp.row][pos_comp.col][0]

                b) In another document

                        This file and AttackSystemDoc.txt are such examples.

B. Testing

        1) For each file written, a unit test should be included.

                a) Unit tests are kept under the &quot;spec&quot; folder

                b) Unit tests should be named class_to_test_spec.rb

                c) spec/spec_helper.rb preloads all the files needed for tests.
                Alter this file to load new files.

                d) Look here to learn more about writing good rspec tests: http://betterspecs.org/

                        i) In short, unit tests should test one specific function

                        ii) There should be many of them that exhaustively test the code.

                e) The code base currently has several examples of tests.

        2) Unit tests should be written shortly after file creation

                a) A good rule of thumb is not to check in code without tests

                b) Generally, I have followed what I like to call TVD &quot;Test
                Verification Development&quot;. I write code for some methods and then
                write tests to ensure it is working. Then, repeat.

        3) Unit tests should be written for new features added to old code

        4) Unit tests should be updated when old features are changed 

        5) Broken unit tests should be fixed ASAP

                a) Before submitting code, run &quot;rspec spec&quot; in the top level directory.
                It will run all the unit tests. They should all pass.

C. Naming

        1) Follow the style guide Ruby:

                https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#naming

        2) In general:

                a. classes are CamelCase

                b. Files, local variables, and methods are snake_case

                        motion_system.rb
                        good_variable
                        def cool_method()

        3) Documentation files such as this should be CamelCased and .txt files

                a. AttackSystemDoc.txt

D. Coding

        1) Try to follow the preferred practices of Ruby

        2) Reek your code.

                a) Reek will denote important ways in which the code can be
                improved.

                b) Keep in mind Reek is just a heuristic. Though helpful, it
                does not need to be followed to the tee.</pre>

<p>Concluding Remarks:</p>

<pre>While this document is not meant to be legalistic, please do try to follow
the coding practices as much as possible. In my coding experience thus far,
I have found these things to be vastly helpful for code cleanliness and
healthiness. 

        1) Communication is important within the team. Hence, good documentation is key.

        2) Catching bugs early with testing is much easier than having to debug a
        large system with multiple points of failure

        3) Good coding practices help make code more readable.

As stated in the preamble, feel free to propose changes or amendments to
this documentation.</pre>
